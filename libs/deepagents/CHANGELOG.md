# deepagents

## 1.13.4-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- [#837](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/837) [`22cc873`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/22cc873c3d7f85cb523c3390c65f4d041557992c) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - fix(middleware): omit repeated conversation and state inputs from owned middleware lifecycle traces

  Keep middleware spans and outputs, and preserve model/tool tracing and user-supplied middleware policies. Apply the defaults to standalone middleware, subagents, and QuickJS cleanup. Lifecycle chain events also receive the omitted inputs.

## 1.13.3

### Patch Changes

- [#797](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/797) [`b393223`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/b393223f6f6f37716979ee23ed561338f7ea63fc) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - Enforce harness-profile tool exclusions inside declarative subagents using each subagent model's profile.

- [#800](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/800) [`2cce30d`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/2cce30d269f25d3b8836bdce73ea84c08f8e4fbb) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - Add experimental conversation forking for subagents (`mode: "fork"`), inheriting the parent's message history and system prompt for prompt-cache reuse.

- [#810](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/810) [`5f69f35`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/5f69f3510b4ecc7e9ad989c009e5ea16886ff812) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - Fix a declarative subagent silently getting no tools when it omitted its own `tools` field (now correctly falls back to the parent's tools, as documented), and make `createDeepAgent` throw at construction if two subagents share a name instead of silently letting the later one win. Also drop the separate `ForkedSubAgent` type — `mode: "fork"` is now just a value on `SubAgent` — and allow a fork to declare its own `systemPrompt`, appended to the parent's inherited prompt instead of being rejected.

## 1.13.2

### Patch Changes

- [#786](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/786) [`3ab66a7`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/3ab66a7470248004da795f85c3eda2c0f6e20b23) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - feat(filesystem): report remaining lines for paginated file reads

  Add optional read pagination metadata across built-in backends and append a model-facing continuation notice when more source lines remain. Size-based truncation now preserves complete source-line boundaries and recalculates the next offset so subsequent reads do not skip hidden content.

- [#793](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/793) [`a78d727`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/a78d72745a5b35cdebdad4986d28e7979057948e) Thanks [@ccurme](https://github.com/ccurme)! - Reject tool calls excluded by harness profiles instead of only hiding the tools from model requests.

## 1.13.1

### Patch Changes

- [#771](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/771) [`bcc2f5d`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/bcc2f5d0a8ac22898b716fc00b425fee208c8b86) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - fix(deepagents): require `mode: "fork"` on `ForkedSubAgent`

  `ForkedSubAgent.mode` was optional, defaulting to being omitted per its own documented example. Since `SubAgent.systemPrompt` is also optional, a `ForkedSubAgent` that omitted `mode` had the same shape as a plain `SubAgent` and silently misrouted between forking and non-forking behavior. `mode: "fork"` is now required on `ForkedSubAgent`, closing the ambiguity.

- [#776](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/776) [`95afe3e`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/95afe3e2682622067a263d2d24129985535b0f3b) Thanks [@baskaryan](https://github.com/baskaryan)! - chore(deepagents): widen the `langsmith` peer range to `>=0.7.1 <0.10.0`

  The upper bound stops below 0.10.0 rather than 1.0.0 because langsmith is pre-1.0 and ships breaking changes in minor bumps, so a new minor should be adopted deliberately instead of pre-authorized.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#675](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/675) [`ba8d4aa`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/ba8d4aa71664c23027e57eee0fcaa2701d60408f) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - feat(filesystem): add recursive delete tool

- [#752](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/752) [`b20d6ad`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/b20d6adc3dc7caf01281832548a17f381561318c) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - feat(deepagents): add `ForkedSubAgent` for subagent conversation forking

  Lets a subagent inherit the parent's conversation history instead of only seeing the task description.

### Patch Changes

- [#759](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/759) [`85a55e1`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/85a55e14da6cb19877ddd81d898d78d6ededfe74) Thanks [@christian-bromann](https://github.com/christian-bromann)! - fix(deepagents): cap sandbox glob find so root searches cannot OOM the host

  Recursive glob listed every path under the search root (and with `-L` could loop through `/proc/*/root`). Prune virtual filesystems and soft-cap find output so a `glob("**/x", "/")` cannot exhaust the runtime heap.

- [#768](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/768) [`f124127`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/f124127255fbd4e4b03eb84a4b39c70421a07e35) Thanks [@casparb](https://github.com/casparb)! - fix(deepagents): accept permission paths that exactly equal a composite route

  A permission path equal to a single-file mount (e.g. `/instructions.md`) was rejected when the backend supported execution, forcing users to write `/instructions.md/**`. The route-scoping check now also accepts the route root itself. Sibling prefixes such as `/workspace2/**` for route `/workspace` remain rejected.

- [#769](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/769) [`d4045de`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/d4045de67715bf3cd6198b0d516d176c0e4b75d0) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - chore(deps): update langgraph deps to track serialization fix

## 1.12.4

### Patch Changes

- [#747](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/747) [`b2afb8d`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/b2afb8d600570b633fd97d4d2f8fd8bdb229ce35) Thanks [@casparb](https://github.com/casparb)! - fix(deepagents): batch concurrent Context Hub mutations

- [#751](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/751) [`68337fc`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/68337fcca19a6d7cc18e8917d575ea9ca3aebcbe) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - fix(deepagents): coerce grep tool's max_count to a number

- [#749](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/749) [`7550c65`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/7550c65204bdd9141a88b9b42d46899e05c7bc43) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - fix(deepagents): exclude summarization state from subagent input/output

## 1.12.3

### Patch Changes

- [#724](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/724) [`77e104f`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/77e104f26a62ae34afbb1393edf191009d37280c) Thanks [@gethin-langchain](https://github.com/gethin-langchain)! - feat(deepagents): add `output_mode` parameter to the `grep` tool (`files_with_matches` / `content` / `count`)

- [#732](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/732) [`239be7e`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/239be7e883227e463504652bc00272ec947a21a6) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - fix(deepagents): disable summary-input trimming by default

  Match Python DeepAgents by providing the full selected conversation to the summarizer unless `trimTokensToSummarize` is explicitly configured. This prevents oversized tool results from producing context-empty summaries under the default configuration.

- [#739](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/739) [`1439bbf`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/1439bbfb267e92b7a19ce0924399591495976c21) Thanks [@taoche](https://github.com/taoche)! - fix(deepagents): extract text from content blocks when building the summary

## 1.12.2

### Patch Changes

- [#723](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/723) [`590c2a5`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/590c2a5042473f096d5fac5ddbb4be96e2ace0f2) Thanks [@thushanth-bengre-langchain](https://github.com/thushanth-bengre-langchain)! - fix(deepagents): prevent stack overflow in CompositeBackend grep/glob on huge result sets, and add a grep match-count cap

  `CompositeBackend` accumulated merged `ls`/`grep`/`glob` results with `push(...entries)`, which passes every entry as a separate function argument and overflows the call stack (RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded) when a broad search over a large tree returns hundreds of thousands of entries. Results are now accumulated with a plain loop, so no result-set size can overflow the stack.

  `grep` also gains an optional `maxCount` (backend) / `max_count` (tool) cap, mirroring the Python SDK. When the cap is hit, results are flagged `truncated: true` on `GrepResult`/`GlobResult` and the grep tool appends a note telling the model to narrow the search. The cap defaults to 1000 via the `grepMaxCount` middleware option (set to `null` to disable). `CompositeBackend` splits the budget across routed backends and OR-propagates the `truncated` flag on merged results.

## 1.12.1

### Patch Changes

- [#713](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/713) [`ffec5de`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/ffec5de0e66ed5ab64bc4c6bee2ff90effb4bfa1) Thanks [@gethin-langchain](https://github.com/gethin-langchain)! - fix(deepagents): grep/glob match when `path` points directly at a file

  We've observed that current models don't need as verbose of prompting guidance, so we're reducing the amount of perscriptive guidance that deepagents has. This is reflected in the generic system prompt (which is now blank), and in the tool descriptions (which have been simplified).

  Adds a `DeleteResult` type and optional backend `delete` method, preserves delete through backend protocol adaptation, and implements file deletion across the built-in state, store, filesystem, composite, context hub, sandbox, and node-vfs backends.

## 1.10.6

### Patch Changes

- [#608](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/608) [`d7ecab2`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/d7ecab2d9f9d41321a043eed6edc3366a1381a67) Thanks [@aolsenjazz](https://github.com/aolsenjazz)! - fix(deepagents): forward subagent results as text

  Fixed a 400 `invalid_request_error` that occurred when a subagent used an Anthropic server-side tool (web search, web fetch, or code execution): the subagent's `server_tool_use`/`*_tool_result` blocks were forwarded to the parent agent as `tool_result` content, which the API rejects. Subagent results are now passed back to the parent as their text content (matching the Python implementation), which resolves the error and also handles a trailing empty `end_turn` message.

- [#656](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/656) [`1a2b2df`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/1a2b2df5528f0f61870b054fff8291355f6a2a0b) Thanks [@colifran](https://github.com/colifran)! - fix(deepagents): default unknown file extensions to text/plain

  Add bedrockPromptCachingMiddleware to default middleware stack. This automatically opts-in to Bedrock prompt caching for Nova and Anthropic models

- [#613](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/613) [`0ae10d7`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/0ae10d7e26c84203a5273939c9ad7a9c8c8661c6) Thanks [@christian-bromann](https://github.com/christian-bromann)! - fix(deepagents): declare LangChain runtime packages as peer dependencies

  Move `@langchain/core`, `@langchain/langgraph`, `@langchain/langgraph-sdk`, and
  `langchain` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies`, and also declare
  `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint` as a peer (its `BaseCheckpointSaver`/`BaseStore`
  types are part of the public API), so they resolve to a single shared instance in
  the consumer's tree. Previously they were bundled as regular
  dependencies, which let a consumer end up with two copies of `@langchain/core`
  (e.g. `1.2.0` vs `1.2.1`). Because these packages ship classes with private/
  protected fields, the duplicate copies are treated as nominally distinct types,
  producing errors like passing a `ChatOpenAI` model to `createDeepAgent` or a
  compiled graph to the local protocol helpers. As peers, the app controls the
  version and bumping `@langchain/core` no longer requires a `deepagents` release.

## 1.10.5

### Patch Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/598) [`7c4a11e`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/7c4a11eacc11c3720b70d802068300ac3b4d8651) Thanks [@christian-bromann](https://github.com/christian-bromann)! - refactor(stream): use langchain `run.subagents` instead of bespoke transformer

  Remove deepagents' custom `createSubagentTransformer` and rely on the native
  subagent stream that `createAgent` registers (langchain#37739). Keep
  `DeepAgentRunStream` as a compile-time overlay that narrows `run.subagents` to
  declared subagent specs. Update streaming tests for `cause` and per-subagent
  message coverage.

  `createCacheBreakpointMiddleware` and `createMemoryMiddleware` were gating
  the Anthropic-specific `cache_control` write at agent-creation time only.
  When `modelFallbackMiddleware` swapped `request.model` to a non-Anthropic
  provider mid-flight (e.g. on Anthropic 5xx), the marker leaked through
  and the fallback provider rejected the request with
  `400 Unknown parameter: 'cache_control'`. Both middlewares now also
  check `isAnthropicModel(request.model)` inside `wrapModelCall`. Fixes [#550](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/issues/550).

  CompositeBackend now limits fallback route fanout to routes mounted under the requested search path, instead of querying all routed backends unconditionally.

  This avoids unrelated routed backend calls (and side-effect errors) for scoped searches like `path="/workspace"`, while preserving full fanout behavior at root (`path="/"`).

  `createSummarizationMiddleware` counted tokens twice on every model call—once
  inside `truncateArgs` and again for the should-summarize check—even when
  nothing was truncated or summarized. Count once and pass the total into
  `truncateArgs`; recount only when truncation actually modifies messages.

  - Namespace components are validated to prevent wildcard/glob injection
  - Defaults to `["filesystem"]` (or `[assistantId, "filesystem"]` when `assistantId` is set) for backwards compatibility
  - Added integration tests verifying store propagation via invoke config (cloud deployment simulation)

### Patch Changes

- [#218](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/218) [`ae70fa4`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/ae70fa400eb3b9710f7917467574d6e08b6583aa) Thanks [@christian-bromann](https://github.com/christian-bromann)! - fix(deepagents): pass on subagent name

## 1.7.5

### Patch Changes

- [#211](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/211) [`adce96c`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/adce96c7c7a99fd37a2ebbd850984b0793e1f8b4) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - fix(skills): improve skills middleware input validation and add annotations

  Port of Python PR #1189. Hardens `parseSkillMetadataFromContent` with stricter
  coercion/trimming for all YAML fields, adds Unicode lowercase support in
  `validateSkillName`, validates and truncates compatibility length, handles
  `allowed-tools` as YAML list or space-delimited string, and shows
  license/compatibility annotations in the system prompt skill listing.

- [#210](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/210) [`2eea576`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/2eea576809f5f89ec29ba9f9425f9a113e6db365) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - refactor(summarization): state rework, move to wrap pattern

  Refactors `createSummarizationMiddleware` to use the `wrapModelCall` hook instead of `beforeModel`. Instead of rewriting LangGraph state with `RemoveMessage(REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES)` on each summarization, the middleware now tracks a `SummarizationEvent` in private state and reconstructs the effective message list on each call, avoiding full state rewrites. Supports chained summarizations with correct cutoff index progression.

## 1.7.4

### Patch Changes

- [#208](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/208) [`4ea1858`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/4ea18587a3799a1cffcfa706ae00c5b9a89040b3) Thanks [@antonnak](https://github.com/antonnak)! - fix(skills): use systemMessage.concat() instead of systemPrompt string in SkillsMiddleware

  Aligns SkillsMiddleware.wrapModelCall with FilesystemMiddleware and SubAgentMiddleware
  by using request.systemMessage.concat() instead of request.systemPrompt string concatenation.
  This preserves SystemMessage content blocks including cache_control annotations for
  Anthropic prompt caching.

## 1.7.3

### Patch Changes

- [#200](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/200) [`a837eac`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/a837eacb8145b3c5467c56d18946cf7ae1ddb69f) Thanks [@JadenKim-dev](https://github.com/JadenKim-dev)! - fix: normalize path handling for cross-platform compatibility

  The BaseSandbox shell commands for lsInfo, globInfo, and grepRaw now work across three environments via runtime detection:
  - GNU Linux (Ubuntu, Debian): uses find -printf for efficient metadata listing
  - BusyBox / Alpine: uses find -exec sh -c with stat -c for size/mtime and POSIX test builtins for file type detection
  - BSD / macOS: uses find -exec stat -f as a fallback
